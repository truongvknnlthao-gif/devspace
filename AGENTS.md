# DevSpace

This project exposes a local development workspace over MCP so ChatGPT, Claude,
or another MCP-capable host can operate directly on this machine's approved
development directories.

The goal is not to delegate work to a separate local coding agent. The MCP host
should call tools that read files, edit files, search code, and run shell
commands directly against approved local project roots.

Pi's SDK is currently used as the backend adapter for mature local coding
primitives such as read, edit, write, grep, find, ls, and bash. DevSpace wraps
those primitives behind a remote Streamable HTTP MCP interface, suitable for use
through a Cloudflare Tunnel.

The model-facing workflow is workspace based. MCP clients should call
`open_workspace` once per local project directory or worktree, then reuse the
returned `workspaceId` for subsequent tool calls in that same folder. Do not
call `open_workspace` again for the same folder unless the `workspaceId` is
rejected as unknown, the client switches folders/worktrees or checkout/worktree
mode, or the user explicitly asks to reopen. `AGENTS.md` files are returned
automatically by `open_workspace` and by later tool calls when the requested path
enters a directory with instructions that have not been loaded for that
workspace.

Core constraints:

- Treat this as remote access to the local machine; security is part of the
  core design, not a later add-on.
- Set the trust boundary at owner approval, the DevSpace operating-system user,
  and the configured workspace roots. After an owner approves a trusted client,
  do not add command-text, filename, credential, service, or destination deny lists.
- Prefer explicit, inspectable tool calls over autonomous local agent loops.
- Long-running shell work must use durable jobs with idempotent request IDs,
  resumable logs, process-group cancellation, and recovery after reconnects.
- Never replace the currently serving runtime in place. Build and validate a
  candidate on a separate port, then use an atomic switch with automatic rollback.
